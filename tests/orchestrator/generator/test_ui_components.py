"""UI component tests with mock user interactions.

These tests simulate user interactions with the UI components
to ensure they work correctly without requiring actual user input.

TODO: Refactor UI classes to move business logic out of UI components for better testability.
The current UI classes are tightly coupled with the Textual framework, making them difficult
to test. We need to:
1. Extract business logic from TaskEditorApp and InputModal into separate service classes
2. Create interfaces/abstract classes for UI components that can be easily mocked
3. Separate data manipulation logic from UI rendering logic
4. Create testable business logic classes that handle task management operations
5. Make UI components thin wrappers around business logic services
